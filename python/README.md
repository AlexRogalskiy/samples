# Python Sample App

This example shows how to leverage [Okteto](https://okteto.com) to develop a Python Sample App directly in the cloud. The Python Sample App is deployed using raw Kubernetes manifests.

Okteto works in any Kubernetes cluster by reading your local Kubernetes credentials. For a empowered experience, follow this [guide](https://okteto.com/docs/samples/python/) to deploy the Python Sample App in our [Free Trial Okteto Kubernetes Cluster](https://cloud.okteto.com).


## Step 1: Install the Okteto CLI

Install the Okteto CLI by following our [installation guides](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/blob/master/docs/installation.md).

## Step 2: Deploy the sample app

Get a local version of the sample application by executing the following commands in your local terminal:

```console
git clone https://github.com/okteto/samples
cd samples/python
```

You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple python application and a `requirements.txt`, which is used by Pythonâ€™s dependency manager, `pip`.

In the `manifest/` directory you also have raw Kubernetes manifests that we will use in this guide to deploy the application in the cluster. Okteto works however independently of your common deployment practices or tools.

> If you donÂ´t have `kubectl` installed, follow this [guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

Run the Voting app by executing:

```console
kubectl apply -f manifests
```

## Step 3: Create your Okteto Environment

With the app deployed, you can start your Okteto Environment by running the following command:

```console
$ okteto up
 âœ“  Okteto Environment activated
 âœ“  Files synchronized
 âœ“  Your Okteto Environment is ready
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      vote
    Forward:   8080 -> 8080
    
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 899-835-619
 ```

The `okteto up` command will automatically start an Okteto Environment. It will also start a file synchronization service to keep your changes up to date between your local filesystem and your Okteto Environment.

You can now access the Voting app at http://localhost:8080.

## Step 4: Develop directly in the cloud

Now things get more exciting. Open `app.py` in your favorite local IDE and modify the `getOptions` function with the following code, and save your file:

```python
def getOptions():
    optionA = 'Otters'
    optionB = 'Dogs'
    return optionA, optionB
```

Go back to the terminal and notice that flask already detected the code changes and reloaded your application.

```console
...
 * Detected change in '/src/app.py', reloading
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 778-756-428
```

Go back to the browser, and reload the page. Notice how your changes are instantly applied. No commit, build or push required ðŸ˜Ž! 


## Step 5: Cleanup

Cancel the `okteto up` command by pressing `ctrl + c` and run the following commands to remove the resources created by this guide: 

```console
okteto down -v
 âœ“  Okteto Environment deactivated
 
```

```console
kubectl delete -f manifests
deployment.apps "vote" deleted
service "vote" deleted
```
