# Django + Celery Sample App

This example shows how to leverage [Okteto](https://okteto.com) to develop a Django + Celery Sample App directly in Kubernetes. The Django + Celery Sample App is deployed using raw Kubernetes manifests.

Okteto works in any Kubernetes cluster (local or remote) by reading your local Kubernetes credentials.

## Step 1: Install the Okteto CLI

Install the Okteto CLI by following our [installation guides](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/blob/master/docs/installation.md).


## Step 2: Django + Celery Sample App

Clone the repository and go to the django folder.

```console
git clone https://github.com/okteto/samples
cd samples/django
```

The Django + Celery Sample App is a multi-service application. It consists of a web view, a worker, a queue, a cache and a DB. 
Deploy the entire application by using the following command:

```console
kubectl apply -f manifests
statefulset.apps "cache" created
service "cache" created
statefulset.apps "db" created
service "db" created
statefulset.apps "queue" created
service "queue" created
deployment.apps "web" created
service "web" created
deployment.apps "worker" created
```

Check that all pods are ready. You can do it by running the command below:
```
$ kubectl get pod                                                                                      
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cache-0                   1/1     Running   0          33m
db-0                      1/1     Running   0          33m
okteto-web-0              1/1     Running   0          10m
queue-0                   1/1     Running   0          33m
web-bfdcd7f69-cg8zl       1/1     Running   0          8m56s
worker-6bdd6c848c-qs48m   1/1     Running   0          8m56s
```

## Step 3: Create your Okteto Environment

In order to activate your Cloud Native Development, execute:

```console
okteto up
 âœ“  Files synchronized
 âœ“  Okteto Environment activated
    Namespace: pchico83
    Name:      shell

root@shell-f6f5d9d5d-kd5qb:/okteto# 
```

The `okteto up` command will start a remote development environment that automatically synchronizes and applies your code changes to the web and worker deployments without having to rebuild or redeploy (eliminating the **docker build/push/pull/redeploy** cycle).

Once your environment is active, verify that the application is up and running by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080/jobs/ (Okteto is automatically forwarding port 8080 between your pod and your computer). 

## Step 4: Develop directly in the cloud

Now things get more exciting. Go to your browser, and try to calculate the `fibonacci` number for the number `5`. To do it, put the values shown below in the web UI, leaving everything else as is.

```console
Type: fibonacci
Argument: 5
```

Press the `POST` button to submit the operation. The response payload will include the `url` of the job. Go to `http://localhost:8080/jobs/1/` and you will notice that the result is wrong (hint: the fibonacci number of 5 is not 32). This is because our worker has a bug ðŸ™€!

Typically, fixing this would involve you running the app locally, fixing the bug, building a new container, pushing it and redeploying your app. Instead, we're going to do it the Cloud Native way:

Open `myproject/myproject/models.py` in your favorite IDE, and modify the value of the `task` variable in line 29 to apply the correct operation as shown below, and save your file.

```python
task = TASK_MAPPING['power']
```

to

```python
task = TASK_MAPPING[self.type]
```

Go back to http://localhost:8080/jobs/, reload the page, and submit a new `fibonacci` calculation, using the same values as before. Go to `http://localhost:8080/jobs/2/`, and see if the result is correct this time (hint: the fibonacci number of 5 is 5).


How did this happen? Well, with Okteto, your changes were automatically applied as soon as you saved them, no commit, build or push required ðŸ’ª! 

## Step 5: Cleanup

Cancel the `okteto up` command by pressing `ctrl + c` and run the following command to remove the resources created by this guide: 

```console
okteto down -v
 âœ“  Okteto Environment deactivated

```
 and finally delete the application by running:

```console
kubectl delete -f manifests
statefulset.apps "cache" deleted
service "cache" deleted
statefulset.apps "db" deleted
service "db" deleted
statefulset.apps "queue" deleted
service "queue" deleted
deployment.apps "web" deleted
service "web" deleted
deployment.apps "worker" deleted
```
